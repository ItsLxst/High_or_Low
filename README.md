# ðŸŽ¯ High or Low

High or Low is a simple Python number guessing game in Python.  
The game randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and you have to guess it.  
You can choose a difficulty level:

- **Easy**: 10 attempts  
- **Hard**: 5 attempts  

After each guess, the game tells you if your guess is **too high** or **too low**.  
The game ends when you guess the number or run out of attempts.
